                I'm a senior Computer Science student based in Texas, passionate about building intuitive 
                and efficient software. My goal is to become a software engineer specializing in 
                web development, where I can create seamless and engaging digital experiences.

                <p>
                Beyond coding, I love roller skating, running, and diving into video games. I also love to eat,
                I'm always on the lookout for great food. Whether it's programming or continuing to grow in my 
                hobbies, I enjoy tackling life with creativity and enthusiasm.
